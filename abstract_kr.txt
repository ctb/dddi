Over the last roughly 20 years, biologists have amassed a substantial
(and growing) catalog of complete genome sequences. These sequences
contain the the basic instructions for synthesizing and assembling
many molecular "parts" into functioning cells and organisms. Yet
despite detailed knowledge of many individual sequences, we lack a set
of general rules that describes how the contents of the genome are
knit together to form functioning cellular systems that do things like
grow, reproduce, and respond to the environment. My lab is developing
analytical methods to compare genome information across species, with
the basic idea that we can use this information to create statistical
models for how cellular systems are built. In principle, knowledge of
the statistical constraints underlying the design of cellular systems
would provide practical rules for the engineering of pathways with
industrial or medical relevance, and a context for understanding the
molecular basis of disease-causing mutations.
